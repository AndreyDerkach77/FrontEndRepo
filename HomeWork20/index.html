                        Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Trees cover up a
                        multitude of sins. Isn't that fantastic that you can
                        make whole mountains in minutes? Have fun with it. It's
                        hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step
                        back and look. You could sit here for weeks with your
                        one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it
                        with one stroke with an almighty brush.

                        We don't have anything but happy trees here. See. We
                        take the corner of the brush and let it play
                        back-and-forth. You can work and carry-on and put lots
                        of little happy things in here. Without washing the
                        brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some
                        Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. This is a
                        fantastic little painting. The first step to doing
                        anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in
                        your mind before you ever start.

                        Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree
                        out of your brush like that. Happy painting, God bless.
                        You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold
                        painting. And right there you got an almighty cloud. A
                        fan brush can be your best friend. Look at them little
                        rascals.

                        Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.
                        For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
                        There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
                        Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over
                        here. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of
                        every single one of us. So often we avoid running water,
                        and running water is a lot of fun.
